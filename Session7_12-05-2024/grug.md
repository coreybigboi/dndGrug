## Character Backstory
Grug grew up in the northern icy tundras in a village called Grug. His mother was an orc and his father a half-orc. All males in this village are called "Grug" and the females "Grugetta". Their culture centres around battle, and it is considered a great dishonor to grow old, as it suggests you did not fight worthy foes. Both men and women are expected to fight, and all Grug villagers are proficient blacksmiths. It is customary to go on a death pilgrimage during your physical peak, with the goal being to die with glory. Grug has left his wife Grugetta in the village to go on his own death pilgrimage, where they both hope he finds an honorable death. 

### Folk Hero Defining Event
Grug's father was not a typical Grug, he hated violence and spent his days writing poetry. Everyone hated him. He refused to go on his death pilgrimage and had grown very old (38 years old) without having any battle scars. One day he was performing his poetry in the village square when Grug finally had enough. He challenged his father to a death duel, which cannot be refused if issued by direct kin. Even Grug's father knew he could not decline. He begged Grug to seek a path of non-violence. Instead, Grug decapitated him, causing the village to cheer and so Grug became the village hero. His mother is very proud of him.
