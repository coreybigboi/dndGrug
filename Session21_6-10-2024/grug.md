## ‚áÅ Features / Traits üé≠

- [ ] Relentless Endurance: When reduced to 0HP but not killed, drop to 1HP instead. Can only be used once per long rest.

- [ ] Second Wind: On bonus action regain hp 1d10 +  fighter level. Once per short rest.

- [ ] Action surge: On turn take an additional action. Once per short / long rest. 

- Weapon Mastery
 [x] Longsword (Sap): If you hit a creature with a Longsword, that creature has Disadvantage on its next attack roll before the start of your next turn.

 Halberd (cleave): If you hit a creature you can make a melee attack roll with the halberd against a second creature within 5 feet of the first that is also within reach. On hit, the second creature takes the halberd's damage, but don't add your ability modifier to that damage unless the modifier is negative. You can make this extra attack only once per turn. 

 Greatsword (graze): If attack roll misses a creature, you can deal damage to that creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the attack roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the greatsword, and the damage can be increased only by increasing the ability modifier.

- Fighting Style - Dueling: 1H melee +2 bonus to damage rolls

- Extra Attack: Attack twice when taking the Attack action 

- Savage Attacks: On critical hit, roll 1 of the weapon's dice and add to extra dmg.

- Dark Vision: 60ft (can only see in grey)

- Rustic Hospitality: Fit among common folk with ease. Can find a place to hide and rest among commoners, unless you have shown to be a danger. This will shield you from the law or someone looking for you, but they will not risk their lives for you.

- Tactical Mind: When you fail an ability check, you can expend a use of your Second Wind to push yourself toward success. Rather than regaining hit points, you roll 1d10 and add the number rolled to the ability check, potentially turning it into a success. If the check still fails, this use of Second Wind isn't expended.

- Tactical Shift: Whenever you activate your Second Wind with a Bonus Action, you can move up to half your Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.

## ‚áÅ Character Backstory üìÉ

Grug grew up in the northern icy tundras in a village called Grug. His mother was an orc and his father a half-orc. All males in this village are called "Grug" and the females "Grugetta". Their culture centres around battle, and it is considered a great dishonor to grow old, as it suggests you did not fight worthy foes. Both men and women are expected to fight, and all Grug villagers arce proficient blacksmiths. It is customary to go on a death pilgrimage during your physical peak, with the goal being to die with glory. Grug has left his wife Grugetta in the village to go on his own death pilgrimage, where they both hope he finds an honorable death. 

### Folk Hero Defining Event

Grug's father was not a typical Grug, he hated violence and spent his days writing poetry. Everyone hated him. He refused to go on his death pilgrimage and had grown very old (38 years old) without having any battle scars. One day he was performing his poetry in the village square when Grug finally had enough. He challenged his father to a death duel, which cannot be refused if issued by direct kin. Even Grug's father knew he could not decline. He begged Grug to seek a path of non-violence. Instead, Grug decapitated him, causing the village to cheer and so Grug became the village hero. His mother is very proud of him.
